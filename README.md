# Black-Scholes-Merton-Option-Pricing-Model
The Black-Scholes model, also known as the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model, is one of the most important concepts in modern financial theory. This mathematical equation estimates the theoretical value of derivatives other investment instruments, taking into account the impact of time and other risk factors.
The model is applied on Matlab code, which is function-independent, since the N-distribution for the calculation of N(d1) & N(d2) is created manually as a Matlab sym function.
