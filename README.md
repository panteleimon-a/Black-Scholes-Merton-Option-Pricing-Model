# Black-Scholes-Merton-Option-Pricing-Model
The Black-Scholes model, also known as the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model, is one of the most important concepts in modern financial theory. The mathematical representation of the model is conducted in Matlab, and estimates the theoretical value of derivatives other investment instruments, taking into account the impact of time and other risk factors.
The model is function-independent, since the N-distribution for the calculation of N(d1) & N(d2) is approximated manually as a Matlab sym function.
